# 🚀 Stocko - Fixed and Ready!

## ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **API Key Security** - Removed exposed API key, added validation
2. **Missing Animations** - Added all required Tailwind animations
3. **Runtime Errors** - Added error boundary and better error handling
4. **GitHub Copilot Message** - This is just an IDE notification, not a Stocko error
